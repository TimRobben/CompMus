# CompMus
One of the genres I am very interested in is the making of music for films. So for this corpus I have chosen to compare two of the greatest film music composers of all time: John Williams and Hans Zimmer. John Williams is the biggest film music composer of the last decades of the 20th century. His music was used in films like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Home Alone and Harry Potter. Hans Zimmer is the biggest composer of the 21st century. His repertoire contains Gladiator, Pearl Harbor, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Last Samurai, Madagascar, The Da Vinci Code, Kung Fu Panda, The Dark Knight-trilogie, Sherlock Holmes, Inception, Man of Steel, Interstellar, Dunkirk and The Lion King. The aim of this project is to compare these two great composers and to see if they have similarities or if they are very different. 
For this I will use the "This is" of both artist on spotify. The playlist of John Williams contains 50 songs and the playlist of Hans Zimmer contains 70 songs.

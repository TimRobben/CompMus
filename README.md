# CompMus
# I chose the corpus which is a playlist I have updated with new songs since i was 15 or so. It includes mostly rock songs, this is a broad genre and I think it is # decently represented in the playlist. It has songs from every decade from the 70's to about now with a couple songs from the 60's. This is alternative rock, hard # rock, metal rock and pop rock. In addition it has indie rock and pop and a couple of diffrent songs in other genres. I like it obviously but i think it is also 
# interesting to see if it these different types of the same mother genre have a lot of things in common or if they are very different after all. It contains a lot 
# coldplay, Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, System of a Down etc. This is a interesting composition in my opinion. It is a decent representation I think but they are 
# are a lot of gaps. For metal for example it only contains System of a Down, and linkin park which isn't even really considered metal. The whole playlist contains 
# 253 songs. Interesting songs in this playlist I think are Breezeblocks by Alt-j to see the indie rock music, Alive by Pearl Jam which represents the 90's grunge scene. Also there is Sympathy for the devil by the Rolling Stones to represent end 60's begin 70's.
